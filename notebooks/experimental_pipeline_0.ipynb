      "-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Decorating in the midst of a financial recession is not easy . But Thom Filicia , host of the Style Network 's `` Dress My Nest , '' author of `` Thom Filicia Style '' and former cast member of `` Queer Eye for the Straight Guy , '' insists that it can be done . `` Paint is very affordable . Pick a color that has life and personality , '' Thom Filicia says . `` I always tell people , ` Start with what you have . ' Work as much with what you have as possible , and then fill in where necessary , '' Filicia said . CNN recently asked the design guru about decorating on a budget and helpful tips to make your home look its best . CNN : When you walk into a room that you 're going to redesign , where does your mind first go ? Thom Filicia : I look at the layout , I look at the way the space is being used , and I try to figure out what the best use of the space is ; that it works really well , it looks good , that you 're getting the best views , you 're seeing the space , and that you 're getting through the space . CNN : And that 's focusing mainly on furniture ? Filicia : That really focuses on all the furniture . You want to look at where the rug is and where the sofa is and coffee tables and chairs -- just how the room works . Even if it 's great-looking stuff , it sometimes does n't look as good as it can look . CNN : What can people on a tight budget do to rearrange their living room and make it look better with what they have ? Filicia : Make sure that your furniture layout works . Make sure that the things you love to look at , you 're seeing . Make sure things are n't cluttered . Paint is very affordable . Pick a color that has life and personality . You could do an accent wall behind your sofa . You could use a low - -LSB- volatile organic compound -RSB- paint so it 's environmentally friendly . You can use inexpensive up lights . You put them on either side of a piece of furniture or behind a tree . You always want to have a Lutron dimmer you plug into the wall . And then plug your lamps into the Lutron dimmer , and you can dim the whole room . CNN : As far as accessories go , like flowers and pillows , where do you draw the line on too much or not enough ? Filicia : I like to keep things clean and straightforward . I think one floral arrangement is usually enough , or maybe a couple really small cute little ones . Pillows should function . You want to sit on a sofa and be comfortable . Start with three : one lumbar in the center and maybe a pair of pillows left and right . Add a throw , a rug for underfoot . Those things start to add layers to the room and make it a little more acoustical . CNN : What are some common designing rules that people always tend to follow but that you can actually break ? Filicia : People think that dark walls make a room smaller . It actually makes the space bigger . All the corners recede , and it adds a lot of depth . Also , I think that color definitely adds a lot of warmth to spaces . CNN : What 's the most common mistake that people make ? Filicia : People just do n't trust their instincts , and they 're not willing to take a risk . Have fun with it . It 's only decorating . People tend to go with beige and white just because they 're afraid or they do n't want to make a commitment . CNN : If someone had just enough money to do one thing in their room , what would you tell them to focus on ? Filicia : The first thing you want to really focus on is a great sofa , because it is really the anchor for the room . In a bedroom , the anchor piece is your bed . Start with your anchor piece , and that 's where you spend your most money . CNN : You have a new book out now , is that right ? Filicia : Yup , I have a book out right now , which is called `` Thom Filicia Style , '' and it 's a great book . It 's a lot of fun . It 's got a lot of great tips in it . It talks about my philosophy ; it talks about color and texture . It 's a very comprehensive book with case studies . CNN : Can you give us some tips for making a place eco-friendly on a tight budget ? Filicia : It 's very easy to use eco-friendly cleaning supplies , environmentally friendly lighting throughout your house using low wattage or eco-friendly bulbs . Also , just turning your lights off when you 're not in a room ; when you 're brushing your teeth not keeping the water running ; taking shorter showers . These are all really simple , easy ways that we can all help Mother Earth repair and heal and replenish itself .\n"
