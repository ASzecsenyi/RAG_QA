# Python Scripts

This directory holds standalone Python scripts used for manually running tasks. These scripts are not part of the main application and are not used for automation.

The main artifact is experiment_runner.py, which is used to run experiments on the application. This script is used to test the application's performance and to generate data for the application's documentation.
